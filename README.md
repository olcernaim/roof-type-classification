Roof Type Classification with Innovative Machine Learning Approaches

Abstract

In this study, roof type classification was made with a small number of examples for training, in accordance with the one-shot learning approach and using the "Siamese Neural Network" method. 
The images used for training were artificially produced due to the difficulty of finding roof data. 
A dataset consisting of real roof pictures was used for the test. The test and training dataset consists of 3 different types: Flat, Gable and Hip. 
Finally, a CNN-based model and a Siamese Neural Network model were trained with the same datasets and the test results were compared with each other.
